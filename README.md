# Master Mind Web Game
First of all we did a python example *`main.py`* to understand how the game works, and for the web page version we did it with javascript *`assets/js/script.js`* using the lastes version to take profit of the newest implementations such as asynchronous functions ...

We used a basic directories layout with css, images and javascript directories

```
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   ├── images
│   └── js
├── index.html
├── main.py
└── README.md
```
